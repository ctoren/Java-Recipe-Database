# Java-Recipe-Database

This database was created with the JDBC API. I started out by compiling a list of categories of desserts to include in the data for my database. The list includes: Cakes, cookies, muffins, pastries, pies, tarts, no bake desserts, and other desserts. I then made a list of 8-10 items or desserts to add to each category. Recipes with ingredients and directions have been compiled for cakes and cookies. All of these recipes have been added to the database. I created a Java class for the database, a class for database variable placeholders (i.e. type, name, ingredients, directions), a GUI class, and a main method class. crand utilized the JDBC API to retrieve recipe data information. The corresponding GUI was designed with Java Swing to enable users to access recipes, add new recipe entries, edit, save, and delete entries. From this project, I learned to work with JDBC API, establish a connection to a JDBC driver, execute simple SQL statements, and integrate Java Swing to output Java objects, rather than JDBC data types.
